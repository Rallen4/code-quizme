## About This Assignment 

The code-quiz assignment required me to write a quiz, develop & design a website to platform this quiz, and then actually deploy a functional javaScript code that would allow for the user to use this quiz online, see their scores, and then have the option to opt into submitting their scores (and display a "Highscores page).

## What I Learned: 

As for the CSS/design, I had an enjoyable time creating an Apex Legends themed quiz and website. I was able to practice CSS fundamentals, and even add a few creative twists to make the page "pop" more (i.e. the background photo, text-shadows, etc).

I also learned how to write JavaScript functions to call upon an action to then lead into another action, or looping. The fundamentals of JavaScript functions really clicked with me after my visit with a tutor, and I was able to tie my website together with logging the data into the local storage. I also understood the concept of globally storing variables, versus locally and why this needs to be done.

## Struggles I Had 

Initially, I had difficulties getting my quiz to actually run. After many hours debugging, I realized my fix was a simple "display:none" function I had written into my CSS many days before. Unfortunately, I ended up deleting my entire project and starting fresh, as I got so frustrated thinking it was wrong I didn't even know where to begin again. While this was not awesome, I got to learn the assignment twice essentially and got an expanded knowledge on the context and how these types of functions can be used in other ways going forward. 

Local Storage and displaying the High Score page were the hardest ending points. I got so close (I think) to accomplishing the high score page, but I ended up commenting out my secondary JavaScript file/code to show as reference but not actual usecase. I plan to finish this portion. Otherwise, the website works and the quiz has functionality and cool design -- so enjoy :)
